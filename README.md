Everything in the materials folder, and assignments in the exercises folder are not my own work, but
made by Professor Joni Kämäräinen. The data in the data folder is also generated by Joni Mäkäräinen and 
can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/c/teenmagi-2022/data. 
All Python files or notebooks in exercises folder are my own unless otherwise mentioned.
